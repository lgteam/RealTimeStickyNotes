# Real-Time Sticky Notes

This is a collaborative website that lets you create and edit Sticky Notes. Updates will be seen at (almost) Real-Time by all other concurrent users on the website.
The solution is an example of how to use AngularJS, jQuery UI and SignalR together.
AngularJS is used for client side objects, jQuery UI for the drag-and-drop, SignalR for Real-Time, data is persisted to database with Entity Framework.
The main use of this project is to learn the above technologies.
